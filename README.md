# A test-driven JS assessment

This repo is my fork of the JS Assessment repo by [Rebecca Murphey](https://github.com/rmurphey), this fork contains the
the solutions to the test so if you want to get to the real JS Assessment you can go [right there](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment)

##How to Run? 

Go the root of the cloned repo and run: 

    npm install
    node bin/serve

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

If you download my repo then all tests should hopefully pass. I'll keep updating the /app folder as i keep passing each of 
the tests.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test

The command line runner is a work in progress;

Kudos to Rebecca!
